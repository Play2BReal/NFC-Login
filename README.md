## Features

- Store multiple NFC cards with passwords
- Automatically type passwords via USB HID or BLE HID
- Switch between USB and BLE modes

## Security

All card data is encrypted using AES-256-CBC with the Flipper Zero's secure enclave. The encryption is device-specific - your encrypted data can't be read on other Flipper Zeros.

You can optionally set a passcode for additional protection. When enabled, you'll need to enter the passcode when opening the app to decrypt your cards.

## Installation

1. Copy the `NFC Login` folder to your Flipper Zero's `applications_user` directory
2. Build using FBT:
   ```bash
   ./fbt launch APPSRC=nfc_login
   ```

## Usage

### First Launch

On first launch, you'll be prompted to set a passcode (unless you disable it in settings). The passcode encrypts your card data and is required each time you open the app.

### Adding a Card

1. Open the app from Applications
2. Enter your passcode if prompted
3. Select **"Add NFC Card"**
4. Enter a name for the card
5. Hold your NFC card/tag to the Flipper when prompted
6. Enter the password to associate with this card

### Using a Card for Login

1. Select **"Start Scan"** from the main menu
2. Hold your NFC card/tag to the Flipper
3. The password will be automatically typed via USB or BLE (depending on your selected mode)
4. Press Back to stop scanning

**Note**: If using BLE mode, pair your device to the Flipper first. It will appear as "Control <Flipper Name>" in Bluetooth settings.

### Selecting a Specific Card

1. Select **"List Cards"** from the main menu
2. Navigate to the card you want (Up/Down to navigate)
3. Press **OK** to select it (you'll see a `*` marker)
4. When scanning, only the selected card will trigger password entry
5. The selected card is remembered across app restarts

### Editing Cards

2. Navigate to the card you want to edit
3. **Hold OK** to open the edit menu
4. Choose what to edit: Name, Password, UID, or Delete
